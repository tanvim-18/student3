What is our project about?
- It is designed to help people live a perfect life. My project was about kids getting distracted in school and playing games in class. Instead of playing meaningless games, We designed games that can help you learn about educational issues, like Chemistry, all while playing a game. Games such as Memory Matching and 2048. To help combine with the other team, as their project was about SAT and colleges, we decided to combine it. Together, we created a database on focused and divided  attentions of students and made it based on their subject level as well as how many solutions they found. For example, you need to pay more attention in science class versus math class, since in math you can know the information, but in a science class you are tested on your ability to remember the information that you learn in class.

Libraries and Setup:
- Imports necessary libraries and sets up a Flask Blueprint (attention_api) for API endpoints.
AttentionModel Class:
- Represents the model for score prediction.
- Singleton pattern ensures one instance for efficient use.
- Initializes by loading data and defining features and target.
- Methods include data cleaning, model training, prediction, and feature importance calculation.
Utility Functions:
- initAttention() initializes the model.
- testAttention() tests the model with a theoretical attention case.
- Execution:
- Checks if the script runs directly and executes the test scenario.

JSON response for error for 400 when missing body on a POST request (postman)

A 400 error is an HTTP status code that indicates a "Bad Request." This error occurs when the server cannot process the client's request due to invalid syntax. For an API or web service, a 400 error often indicates that your request is bad, missing required parameters, or contains invalid data.

In JavaScript, you often use the fetch API to get stuff from a server. When you want to get an array of JSON objects, you start by asking a specific part of the server for it. After you ask, you wait for the response. When it comes back, you check if everything went well, and if it did, you change the response into something you can work with, like an array of objects. Then, you can use this data however you want in your program. It's also important to handle any problems that might happen during this process, like if the network goes down or if the server has issues. You do this to make sure your program doesn't break. By following these steps, you can get and use JSON data in your JavaScript programs.

The JavaScript code provided demonstrates how to handle fetching data from a server and displaying it on the Chrome Browser screen. When you call the fetchData function, it sends a request to a specific server endpoint. Inside the fetch promise chain, the response from the server is checked to see if the request was successful by looking at the status code. If it wasn't successful, an error is triggered. But if the fetch operation succeeds, the response body is treated as JSON in the next .then() block. Then, the parsed JSON data is processed. In this case, it's logged to the console and shown to the user.

To display the fetched data to the user on the Chrome Browser screen, the code dynamically creates a list (<ul>) element to hold the data. For each item in the data array, it creates a list item (<li>) element filled with details from that item. These list items are added to the list element, which is then added to the HTML document's body.

If there's an error during the fetch operation, the code logs it to the console and shows an error message to the user, just like in the previous example. When you run this code in the Chrome Browser and the fetch operation is successful, you'll see the fetched data presented on the screen as a list, making it easy for the user to see the information they requested.

show and describe code that handles failure. Describe how the code shows failure to the user in the Chrome Browser screen (javascript)

The JavaScript code provided illustrates how to handle fetch operation failures and inform the user about them on the Chrome Browser screen. When you call the fetchData function, it sends a request to a specific server endpoint. Inside the fetch promise chain, the code checks if the response from the server indicates a successful request by looking at the status code. If the response suggests an unsuccessful request, an error is thrown.

In the subsequent .catch() block, any errors that occur during the fetch operation, such as network issues or server-side problems, are caught. If an error happens, the code logs it to the console for debugging purposes. Additionally, it dynamically generates a new paragraph (<p>) element to contain the error message, setting its text content to 'Failed to fetch data. Please try again later.'. This error message element is then added to the HTML document's body.

Thus, if the fetch operation fails, the error message is displayed on the Chrome Browser screen, informing the user about the encountered problem and suggesting they try again later.

optional:

Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It aims to find the best-fitting line that minimizes the differences between observed and predicted values. Key concepts include the regression line equation (y = mx + b), assumptions like linearity and independence of residuals, and coefficient estimation using methods like ordinary least squares. 


Decision tree analysis, on the other hand, is a machine learning algorithm for classification and regression tasks. It creates a tree structure where each node represents a decision based on a feature, aiming to maximize homogeneity in resulting subsets. Decision trees are interpretable but prone to overfitting, mitigated by techniques like pruning or using ensemble methods. Both methods have applications in various fields due to their interpretability and effectiveness in modeling relationships between variables.
