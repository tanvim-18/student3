## Week 3 Exit Ticket - We finished the live review. We sent our original note to the teachers but they were not happy with how vague we were so we sent another explaining exactly what we will discuss. We did not get a chance to do our pair showcase because my partner was out sick on Friday. We did however make the changes we needed to to get ready for the pair showcase.
