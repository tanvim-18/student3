- We also made a GitHub account and Slack account 

### Hack Prepartation
> I learned...
- VSCode is a code editor that we would use to debug, for task running, and version control. It is an IDE because it is very easy to edit.
- We also made a Slack account, which is similar to Discord, where we can send and recieve important announcements, and also receive feedback for our problems. 
- We also made a GitHub account, which is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.
