## These are a few questions that I missed on the college board MCQ:

1. Directions: The question or incomplete statement below is followed by four suggested answers or completions. Select the one that is best in each case.

Which of the following actions could be used to help reduce the digital divide?

I.   Providing free education and training on how to use computing devices
II.  Providing free or low-cost computing devices to low-income individuals
III. Providing networks and infrastructure to people in remote areas

I chose the option: I and II only. The correct answer is I, II and III.  A lack of access to networks contributes to the digital divide. This issue could be addressed by providing networks and infrastructure.

2. Directions: The question or incomplete statement below is followed by four suggested answers or completions. Select the one that is best in each case.

The diagram below shows a circuit composed of three logic gates. Each gate takes two inputs and produces a single output.For which of the following input values will the circuit have an output of false ?

A) A equals true, B equals false, C equals false, D equals false
B) A equals true, B equals true, C equals false, D equals false
C) A equals false, B equals false, C equals true, D equals true
D) A equals false, B equals false, C equals false, D equals true

3. Directions: The question or incomplete statement below is followed by four suggested answers or completions. Select the one that is best in each case.

A snack bar has a frequent customer program in which every 10th purchase is free. Customers are enrolled in the program when they make their first purchase. A programmer is writing a program to implement the frequent customer program. In one code segment, cost is set to 0for every 10th purchase by a given customer. The programmer will use the procedure One word, Get Count, open parenthesis, one word, customer I D, close parenthesis , which returns the total number of
purchases a customer has made since enrolling in the frequent customer program, including his or her first purchase.

Which of the following code segments will set cost to 0 for every 10th purchase a customer makes after enrolling in the frequent customer program?

A
The program consists of 5 lines. Begin program Line 1: count, left arrow, one word Get Count, open parenthesis, one word customer I D, close parenthesis Line 2: IF, open parenthesis, count divided by 10 equals 0, close parenthesis Line 3: open brace Line 4: cost, left arrow, 0 Line 5: close brace End program.
B
The program consists of 5 lines. Begin program Line 1: count, left arrow, one word Get Count, open parenthesis, one word customer  I D, close parenthesis Line 2: IF, open parenthesis, NOT, open parenthesis, count divided by 10 equals 0, close parenthesis, close parenthesis Line 3: open brace Line 4: cost, left arrow, 0 Line 5: close brace End program.
C
The program consists of 5 lines. Begin program Line 1: count, left arrow, one word Get Count, open parenthesis, one word customer I D, close parenthesis Line 2: IF, open parenthesis, count, MOD, 10 equals 0, close parenthesis Line 3: open brace Line 4: cost, left arrow, 0 Line 5: close brace End program.
D
The program consists of 5 lines. Begin program Line 1: count, left arrow, one word Get Count, open parenthesis, one word customer I D, close parenthesis Line 2: IF, open parenthesis, NOT, open parenthesis, count, MOD, 10 equals 0, close parenthesis, close parenthesis Line 3: open brace Line 4: cost, left arrow, 0 Line 5: close brace End program.

I answered B, but the correct answer is C. The expression NOT, open parenthesis, count divided by 10 equals 0, close parenthesis does not evaluate to true when count is a multiple of 1 0, so this code segment does not set cost to 0 appropriately.

4. A computer program uses 4 bits to represent nonnegative integers. Which of the following statements describe a possible result when the program uses this number representation?

I. The operation 4 plus 8 will result in an overflow error.

II. The operation 7 plus 10 will result in an overflow error.

III. The operation 12 plus 3 will result in an overflow error.

I chose A but the answer is B. The operation 4 + 8 doesn't produce a result large enough to cause an overflow error.
