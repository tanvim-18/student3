An Internet user has a need to send private data to another user. Which of the following provides the most security when transmitting private data?

Responses
A
Certifying the data with a Creative Commons license before sending it

B
Sending the data using a high-bandwidth connection

C
Sending the data using public-key encryption

D
Sending the data using redundant routing

Answer A
Incorrect. A Creative Commons license allows an individual to publish content while specifying how that content can be legally used or shared. This will not increase the security of private data.

For this question, I wasn't really sure on what a creative commons license was, so I didn't really know what to select for the question. I searched it up and it is basically like a copyright license. It doesn't increase the security of private data, but it allows people to publish content, that can be used or shared.

Ticket prices for a science museum are shown in the following table.

Type of Ticket	General Admission Cost
(in dollars)	Guided Tour Cost
(in dollars)
Regular (ages 13 and up)	8	10
Child (ages 12 and below)	6	8
A programmer is creating an algorithm to display the cost of a ticket based on the information in the table. The programmer uses the integer variable age for the age of the ticket recipient. The Boolean variable includesTour is true when the ticket is for a guided tour and is false when the ticket is for general admission.

Which of the following code segments correctly displays the cost of a ticket?

Incorrect. This code segment initially sets cost to 6, then increases cost by 2 for people who are either going on a guided tour or whose age is greater than 12. Because of the ELSE statement, the cost is not properly set for people who are both older than 12 and going on a guided tour.

I think for this one I was confused about all the if else and/or statements that I chose the wrong one, but I understand the correct answer now.

A library system contains information for each book that was borrowed. Each time a person borrows or returns a book from the library, the following information is recorded in a database.

Name and the unique ID number of the person who was borrowing the book
Author, title, and the unique ID number of the book that was borrowed
Date that the book was borrowed
Date that the book was due to be returned
Date that the book was returned (or 0 if the book has not been returned yet)
Which of the following CANNOT be determined from the information collected by the system?

Responses
A
The total number of books borrowed in a given year

B
The total number of books that were never borrowed in a given year

C
The total number of books that were returned past their due date in a given year

D
The total number of people who borrowed at least one book in a given year

Answer D
Incorrect. This information can be determined by counting the number of unique ID numbers for the people who borrowed at least one book in a given year.

Here, the information can be found from counting the number of unique ID numbers from people who borrowed at least one book in a given year

Q23:
Which of the following statements is equivalent to the algorithm in the flowchart?

Responses
A

The figure presents a block of code that consists of 1 line. Throughout the code there are nested blocks of code. Line 1: [begin block] available ← [Begin Block] [begin block] weekday [end block] OR [begin block] miles are less than 20 [end block] [End Block] [end block]
B

Answer B
Incorrect. This expression would be equivalent to an algorithm that sets available to true whenever weekday is true and miles is at least 20. The algorithm in the flowchart requires both conditions to be true in order to set available to true.

This was a flowchart problem. I almost got the right answer, except I switched the signs for the problem.

overall, I felt that I did much better for this college board quiz than last time. I spent a lot of time on each question, which would be something to work on for next time. I think thatI focus on getting the question right, so it took me a while to finish it. The things that I got wrong were mostly tables
