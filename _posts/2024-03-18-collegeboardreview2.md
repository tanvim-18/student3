I chose B, and the answer is B
Incorrect. The counter is incremented once for each time the game piece moves. The game piece makes four moves before ending in the red space.

Correct. The game piece begins at the rightmost black space. The piece moves one space to the left to a yellow space, and the counter is incremented to 1. The piece then moves three spaces to the left to another yellow space, and the counter is incremented to 2. The piece then moves three spaces to the left to a green space, and the counter is incremented to 3. The piece then moves two spaces to the right to the red space, and the counter is incremented to 4. The algorithm terminates now that the piece is in the red space.

Incorrect. Removing any three connections will not prevent devices B and C from communicating. For example, if connections A-C, C-D, and B-D are removed, then devices B and C can still communicate along the path B-E-F-C.

Correct. Devices B and C must be completely cut off from each other for them to no longer communicate. Removing any three connections will not prevent devices B and C from communicating. However, if connections B-A, B-D, B-E, and B-G are removed (or C-A, C-D, C-F, and C-I), then devices B and C can no longer communicate.

Incorrect. The Internet uses standardized, open (nonproprietary) communication protocols.

Correct. The Internet was designed to be scalable, using open protocols to easily connect additional computing devices to the network.

Question #37:

Incorrect. The string "broccoli" is displayed for values of n that are greater than 10 but less than or equal to 100.

Correct. The string "carrot" can be displayed only when the expression (n > 10) is false and the expression (n > 100) is true. If n is not greater than 10, it cannot be greater than 100, and so "carrot" can never be displayed.

Incorrect. Simulations are simplified abstractions of more-complex objects or phenomena.

Correct. Simulations are most useful when real-world events are impractical. A simulation is unlikely to be appropriate if continuous real-world data is needed.

Question #39

Incorrect. Using 5 bits will only allow for up to 32 sequences because 2^5 = 32. 

Correct. Using 6 bits will only allow for up to 64 sequences because 2^6=64. Using 7 bits will allow for up to 128 sequences because 2^7=128. Therefore, a minimum of 7 bits are needed.

Question #48

Incorrect. Tricking a user into providing personal information is an example of a phishing attack. While this type of attack can be used to obtain personal information, it does not allow unauthorized individuals to intercept information transmitted on a network.

Correct. A rogue access point is a wireless access point that gives unauthorized access to secure networks. Data sent over public networks can be intercepted, analyzed, and modified. One way that this can happen is through a rogue access point.

Question #63

B: Incorrect. For example, when input1 is true and input2 is false, then (NOT input1) will be false and (NOT input2) will be true. Therefore, (NOT input1) AND (NOT input2) will be false instead of the intended value true.

D: Correct. When input1 and input2 are both true, the expression (input1 AND input2) is true, so NOT (input1 AND input2) will evaluate to false. In all other cases, (input1 AND input2) will evaluate to false, so NOT (input1 AND input2) will evaluate to true.

A: Correct. When input1 and input2 are both true, the expressions (NOT input1) and (NOT input2) are both false, so (NOT input1) OR (NOT input2) will evaluate to false. In all other cases, either (NOT input1) or (NOT input2) (or both) will evaluate to true, so (NOT input1) OR (NOT input2) will evaluate to true.
